# System to manage a municipal library

This is a Java application to manage a physical library, with support for books, loan and clients.

## Use of Maven for:
- **Automatic Management of the dependencies** (automatic download of the needed JAR)
- **Standardized Build** (Same commands for all the projects)
- **Simplified Packaging** (it creates a JAR with all the necessary)
- **Clear Structure of the project** (organized filess)
- **Integration with the IDE**
- **Easy addition of plugins** (testing, analisi codice, etc.)

**To work without Maven**, the application needs:
1. Manual download of JDBC PostgreSQL drivers
2. Manual compilazion using `javac`
3. Manual management of the classpath
4. Manual packaging of the JAR
